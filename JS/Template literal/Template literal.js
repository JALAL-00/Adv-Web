/* Template literals are a feature in JavaScript that allow you to create strings in a more readable and flexible way. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes. Template literals support:

Multi-line strings without needing escape characters.
Embedding expressions using ${expression} syntax (string interpolation).
Tagged templates for advanced string manipulation.

1. Basic Syntax

Template literals use backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

const name = "Alice";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;

console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice!
